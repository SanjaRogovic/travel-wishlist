# travel-wishlist exercise WBS Coding School

For this exercise, we will build a simple application where we will store a list of countries you wish to go to! 

You should use an array of objects to store your countries in the country list.

A country object should have the following shape:

{
    id: 1,
    name: “Bhutan”,
    alpha2Code: “BT”,
    alpha3Code: “BTN”
}

ISO Alpha 2 and Alpha 3 codes can be found here ->  https://www.iban.com/country-codes. 
They are standard codes assigned to identify a country.
